# Project Name: TA/CA Locator

# Team Members: Thadeus Labuszewski, Alexander Louie, Colin Murphy, Elsa Velazquez, Roman Zaytsev, John Osborne

I created the project files branch so that we could put all our code for the TA/CA Locator in one branch. I'm not sure why Elsa has a bunch of random files everywhere but I think we can just delete them. Once we are almost finished with this project I think we should also clean up the github so it is easy to navagite.
