I tried to create us a project board branced off of Roman's github page 
https://github.com/Roman260/SoftwareDevProject/projects/1

According to the Doodle poll, we are narrowed down to Mondays some time between 3-8pm.  If I knew how to post images here I would.  

Apologies if i accidentally added my entire github, just learning how to use it.
